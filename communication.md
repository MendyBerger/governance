# Communication Within the Bytecode Alliance

As we all work within the Bytecode Alliance, it is necessary to keep members and community participants informed about new developments with projects or the organization itself. Here are some guidelines on how to share a message with the community at large:

- **Small or Minor Updates**: These updates should be shared on the [Bytecode Alliance Zulip chat](https://bytecodealliance.zulipchat.com/). This includes new releases, updates from Special Interest Groups (SIGs), and requests for comments (RFCs).
- **Larger or Broader Updates**: For significant announcements or updates with wider relevance, get in touch with the [Technical Steering Committee](mailto:tsc@bytecodealliance.org). The TSC will assist in determining the appropriate communication channel, such as an email or a post on the Bytecode Alliance blog. This includes major releases, new projects or SIGs, and changes in governance or operations.

All communications must adhere to the Bytecode Alliance [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/governance/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and be relevant to and aligned with the Bytecode Alliance mission and are governed by the TSC.

## Guidelines for Talking about the Bytecode Alliance and its Projects

Do:

- clearly distinguish personal opinions from Bytecode Alliance positions, using language like "In my personal view" or "My organization believes..."
- confirm facts and ensure accuracy before sharing information
- seek input from relevant SIGs, the TSC, or community members before announcing decisions or milestones that may impact them
- encourage and amplify constructive discussions, respecting diverse viewpoints and fostering collaboration within the community
- acknowledge contributions from individuals and teams, both inside and outside the Bytecode Alliance, when sharing updates about new developments or achievements

Don't:

- present personal or company/organization positions or opinions as those of the Bytecode Alliance unless you have the authority to do so
- represent an idea as group consensus (particularly for SIGs) unless the group has gained that consensus and has it documented publicly
- disparage or talk down about other projects, whether inside or outside of the Bytecode Alliance
